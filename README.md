This paper proposes a hybrid model, S2D2Net (Steel Surface Defect Diagnosis Network), for an efficient and robust inspection of the steel surface during the manufacturing process. The S2D2Net uses a pretrained ImageNet model as a feature extractor and learns a Capsule Network over the extracted features. The experimental results on a publicly available steel surface defect dataset (NEU) show that S2D2Net achieved 99.17% accuracy with minimal training data and improved by 9.59% over its closest competitor based on GAN. S2D2Net proved its robustness by achieving 94.7% accuracy on a diversity enhanced dataset, ENEU, and improved by 3.6% over its closest competitor. It has better, robust recognition performance compared to other state-of-the-art DNN-based detectors.URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9506405&isnumber=9506009
